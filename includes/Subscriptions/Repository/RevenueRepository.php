/**
 * Gap found during Step 15: `wp_purecart_subscription_revenue` has been
 * created by Schema.php since Step 1 and documented there as "Powers MRR/ARR/
 * churn reporting independent of WooCommerce's own order reports" — but
 * nothing in the entire module ever wrote a row to it. Every step since has
 * recorded money only into `wp_purecart_subscription_payments`, which is a
 * per-charge-*attempt* ledger (successes, failures, and refunds alike, stamped
 * with the wall-clock time of the attempt).
 *
 * The two are genuinely different things and both are needed:
 *  - payments answers "what did we try to charge, and did it work?"
 *  - revenue answers "which service period does this money belong to?"
 *    (period_start/period_end), which is what any trend/cohort report needs —
 *    a renewal charged three days late still belongs to its own cycle, not to
 *    the day the retry happened.
 *
 * Populated here by listening to the same `purecart_subscription_renewed`
 * event every other reporting-adjacent class already uses, so no earlier step
 * needed modifying to start filling it.
